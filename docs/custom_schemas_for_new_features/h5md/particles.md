# The particles group

Particle attributes, i.e., information about each particle in the system, are stored within the `particles` group.
According to the original H5MD schema, the `particles` group is a container for subgroups that
represent different subsets of the system under consideration.
For simplicity of parsing, H5MD-NOMAD currently requires one such group, labeled `all`, to contain all the particles and corresponding attributes to be stored in the NOMAD archive.
**Additional particle groups will be ignored**.

For each dataset, the ordering of indices (whenever relevant) are as follows: frame index, particle index, dimension index.
Thus, the contents of the `particles` group for a trajectory with `N_frames` frames and `N_part` particles in a `D`-dimensional space can be represented:

    particles
     \-- all
     |    \-- box
     |    \-- (<time-dependent_vector_attribute>)
     |    |    \-- step: Integer[N_frames]
     |    |    \-- time: Float[N_frames]
     |    |    \-- value: <type>[N_frames][N_part][D]
     |    \-- (<time-dependent_scalar_attribute>)
     |    |    \-- step: Integer[N_frames]
     |    |    \-- time: Float[N_frames]
     |    |    \-- value: <type>[N_frames][N_part]
     |    \-- (<time-independent_vector_attribute>): <type>[N_part][D]
     |    \-- (<time-independent_scalar_attribute>): <type>[N_part]
     |    \-- ...
     \-- <group2>
          \-- ...

## Standardized H5MD elements for particles group

`position`
:   **(required for parsing other particle attributes)** An element that describes the particle positions as coordinate vectors of `Float` or `Integer` type.

<!-- If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` (see [below](#simulation-box)) is set
to `none`, the data indicate for each particle the component $k$ of its
absolute position in space. If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` is set to
`periodic`, the data indicate for each particle the component $k$ of the
absolute position in space of an *arbitrary* periodic image of that particle. -->

`velocity`
:   An element that contains the velocities for each particle as a vector of
    `Float` or `Integer` type.

`force`
:   An element that contains the total forces (i.e., the accelerations
    multiplied by the particle mass) for each particle as a vector of `Float`
    or `Integer` type.

`mass`
:   An element that holds the mass for each particle as a scalar of `Float`
    type.

`image`
:   <a id="image_anchor"></a>**(currently unused in H5MD-NOMAD)** An element that represents periodic images of the box as coordinate vectors
of `Float` or `Integer` type and allows one to compute for each particle its
absolute position in space. If `image` is present, `position` must be
present as well. For time-dependent data, the `step` and `time` datasets of
`image` must equal those of `position`, which must be accomplished by
hard-linking the respective datasets.

<!-- If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` (see [below](#simulation-box)) is set
to `none`, the values of the corresponding component $k$ of `image` serve as
placeholders. If the component $k$ of `box/boundary` is set to `periodic`,
for a cuboid box, the component $k$ of the absolute position of particle $i$
is computed as $R_{ik} = r_{ik} + L_k a_{ik}$, where $\vec r_i$ is taken
from `position`, $\vec a_i$ is taken from `image`, and $\vec L$ from
`box/edges`. -->

`species`
:   **(currently unused in H5MD-NOMAD)** An element that describes the species for each particle, i.e., its
atomic or chemical identity, as a scalar of `Enumeration` or `Integer`
data type. Particles of the same species are assumed to be identical with
respect to their properties and unbonded interactions.

`id`
:   **(currently unused in H5MD-NOMAD)** An element that holds a scalar identifier for each particle of `Integer`
type, which is unique within the given particle subgroup. The `id` serves
to identify particles over the course of the simulation in the case when
the order of the particles changes, or when new particles are inserted and
removed. If `id` is absent, the identity of the particles is given by their
index in the `value` datasets of the elements within the same subgroup.

<!-- A *fill value* (see
[ยง 6.6](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/11_Datatypes.html#Fvalues) in
[@HDF5_users_guide]) may be defined for `id/value` upon dataset creation.
When the identifier of a particle is equal to this user-defined value,
the particle is considered non-existing, the entry serves as a
placeholder. This permits the storage of subsystems whose number of
particles varies in time. For the case of varying particle number, the
dimension denoted by `[N]` above may be variable. -->

`charge`
:   An element that contains the charge associated to each particle as a
    scalar, of `Integer` or `Float` type.

<!-- `charge` has the optional attribute `type` of fixed-length string datatype
and of scalar dataspace, possible values are `effective` and `formal`. In
the case `effective`, the charge is part of an effective description of the
interactions with the precise meaning depending on the underlying empirical
force fields or coarse-grained models.

In the case `formal`, the charge is the so-called "formal charge" assigned
to an atom (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_charge>) and must be
of `Integer` type. This case corresponds to the entries in PDB files (see
definition in the PDBx/mmCIF dictionary
<http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/dictionaries/mmcif_pdbx_v40.dic/Items/_atom_site.pdbx_formal_charge.html>).

If none of `effective` or `formal` describes the data properly, the
attribute `type` may be omitted. -->

## Standardized H5MD-NOMAD elements for particles group

`species_label`
:   <a id="species_label_anchor"></a> An element that holds a label (fixed-length string datatype) for each particle. This label denotes the fundamental species type of the particle (e.g., the chemical element label for atoms), regardless of its given interactions within the model. **Both** time-independent and time-dependent `species_label` elements are supported.

`model_label`
:   An element that holds a label (fixed-length string datatype) for each particle. This label denotes the type of particle with respect to the given interactions within the model (e.g., force field) **Currently only time-independent species labels are supported.**

## Non-standard elements in particles group

**All non-standard elements within the particles group are currently igorned by the NOMAD H5MD parser.** In principle, one can store additional custom attributes as configuration-specific observables (see [The observables group](observables.md)).


## The simulation box subgroup

Information about the simulation box is stored in a subgroup named `box`, within the relevant particles group (`all` in our case).
**Both** time-independent and time-dependent box information are supported (i.e. via the `edges` element).
Because the `box` group is specific to a particle group of particles, time-dependent boxes **must** contain `step` and `time` datasets that exactly match those of the corresponding `position` group.
In principal, this should be accomplished by hard-linking the respective datasets.
In practice, H5MD-NOMAD currently assumes that this is the case (i.e., **the box group `step` and `time` information is unused**), and simply checks that `edges.value` has the same leading dimension as `position`.

The structure of the `box` group is as follows:

    particles
     \-- all
          \-- box
               +-- dimension: Integer[]
               +-- boundary: String[D]
               \-- (edges)

`dimension`
:   An attribute that stores the spatial dimension `D` of the simulation box
    and is of `Integer` datatype and scalar dataspace.

`boundary`
:   <a id="boundary_anchor"></a> An attribute, of boolean datatype (**changed from string to boolean in H5MD-NOMAD**) and of simple dataspace of rank 1 and size `D`, that specifies the boundary condition of the box along each dimension, i.e., `True` implies periodic boundaries are applied in the corresponding dimension. If all values in `boundary` are `False`, `edges` may be omitted.

<!-- Information on the geometry of the box edges is stored as an H5MD element,
allowing for the box to be fixed in time or not.  Supported box shapes are the
cuboid and triclinic unit cell, for other shapes a transformation to the
triclinic shape may be considered [@Bekker:1997]. -->

`edges`
:   A `D`-dimensional vector or a `D` ร `D` matrix, depending on the geometry
of the box, of `Float` or `Integer` type. Only cuboid and triclinic boxes are allowed.
If `edges` is a vector, it specifies the space diagonal of a cuboid-shaped box. If `edges` is a
matrix, the box is of triclinic shape with the edge vectors given by the
rows of the matrix. For a time-dependent box, a cuboid geometry is encoded by a dataset `value`
(within the H5MD element) of rank 2 (1 dimension for the time and 1 for the
vector) and a triclinic geometry by a dataset `value` of rank 3 (1
dimension for the time and 2 for the matrix). For a time-independent box, a cuboid geometry is encoded by a dataset `edges` of rank 1 and a triclinic geometry by a dataset of rank 2.

For instance, a cuboid box that changes in time would appear as:

    particles
     \-- all
          \-- box
               +-- dimension: Integer[]
               +-- boundary: String[D]
               \-- edges
                    \-- step: Integer[variable]
                    \-- time: Float[variable]
                    \-- value: <type>[variable][D]

where `dimension` is equal to `D`. A triclinic box that is fixed in time would
appear as:

    particles
     \-- all
          \-- box
               +-- dimension: Integer[]
               +-- boundary: String[D]
               \-- edges: <type>[D][D]

where `dimension` is equal to `D`.

<!-- TODO - double check that both shapes are supported in the parser! -->
