After uploading the data in the Uploads page, and a successful parsing of the same into the NOMAD metainfo, congratulations! Now you can publish your data and let other users browse through it and re-use it for other purposes.

You can define a speficic `Embargo period` of up to 36 monthsm after which the data will be made publicly available, and under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

After publishing by clicking on `PUBLISH`, the uploaded files are immutable. However, you can still edit the metadata fields.

## Organizing data in datasets {#organize-data-in-datasets}

You can organize your uploads, and even individual entries, by grouping them into common datasets. 

In the uploads page, click on `EDIT AUTHOR METADATA OF ALL ENTRIES`. Under `Datasets` you can either `Create a new dataset` or `Search for an existing dataset`. After selecting the dataset, click on `SUBMIT`.

Now, the defined dataset will be defined under `PUBLISH - Datasets`.

The icon :fontawesome-solid-bookmark: allows you to assign a DOI to a specific dataset. This can then be added into your publication so that it can be used as a reference.
