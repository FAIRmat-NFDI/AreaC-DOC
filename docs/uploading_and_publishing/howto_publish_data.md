You can define a specific `Embargo period` of up to 36 months, after which the data will be made publicly available under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

After publishing by clicking on `PUBLISH`, the uploaded files cannot be altered. However, you can still edit the metadata fields.

## Organizing data in datasets {#organize-data-in-datasets}

You can organize your uploads and individual entries by grouping them into common datasets. 

In the uploads page, click on `EDIT AUTHOR METADATA OF ALL ENTRIES`. 

Under `Datasets` you can either `Create a new dataset` or `Search for an existing dataset`. After selecting the dataset, click on `SUBMIT`.

Now, the defined dataset will be defined under `PUBLISH > Datasets`.

The icon :fontawesome-solid-bookmark: allows you to assign a DOI to a specific dataset. Once a DOI has been assign to a dataset, no more data can be added to it. This can then be added into your publication so that it can be used as a reference, e.g., see the [**Data availability statement** in M. Kuban et al., _Similarity of materials and data-quality assessment by fingerprinting_, MRS Bulletin **47**, 991-999 (2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/s43577-022-00339-w#data-availability).
